# ArrestBaton

THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU HAVENT EDITIED YOUR DARKRP VARS!!!!!!!!!!!
You must either change the concommand being run from "darkrp want" to "darkrp wanted", and "darkrp unwant" to "darkrp unwanted"

Arrest Baton integration with Quick Want

Replace your arrest baton shared file with the one in this repo.
Right click to want the player, right click again to unwant them.

This adds a cooldown aswell to the secondary attack. You do not have to.
